Tasks in Rust
=============

One of the things that Rust is super good at is concurrency. In order to
understand Rust's strengths, you have to understand its approach to
concurrency, and then its approach to memory. The two are inter-related, and
we can't stop glossing over details like "just put ``~`` in front of things
anymore, which makes me really uncomfortable.

Tasks
-----

The fundamental unit of computation in Rust is called a 'task.' Tasks are
similar to 'lightweight' threads in Erlang or Go. Rust tasks are entirely
isolated from one another, though. They're scheduled on an M:N basis to OS
threads, so they're not quite green threads exactly, either: they'll be
parallel as well as concurrent. There can be 200k Rust tasks mapped over 4 OS
threads.

As a Rubyist, you probably don't know anything about that, so let's talk code
first, and get into what exactly all that means later. Here's some code that
prints "Hello" 100 times::

  fn main() {
    for 100.times {
      io::println("Hello");
    }
  }

You may remember this from earlier. This loops 100 times, printing "Hello." Now
let's make it roflscale with tasks::

  use task::spawn;

  fn main() {
    for 100.times {
      do spawn {
        io::println("Hello");
      }
    }
  }

That's it! We spin up 100 tasks that print stuff. If you inspect your output,
you can tell it's working::

  Hello
  HelloHello

  Hello

Ha! Printing to the screen is obviously something that tasks can step over each
other with. But the vast majority of things aren't like that. Let's take a look
at the type signature of ``spawn``::

  fn spawn(f: ~fn())

Spawn is a function that takes a pointer to another function. But there's that
``~`` again. This means that the pointer is an 'owned pointer.' We'll talk
more about what exactly that means in the next chapter, but you can infer from
the name that this means that we own all of the references to the data in this
closure. Therefore, Rust can move the function around at will and know it won't
break anything. The type system has helped us determine exactly how isolated
our task actually is.

Pipes, Channels, and Ports
--------------------------

If our tasks are 100% isolated, they wouldn't be that useful: we need some
kind of communication between tasks in order to get back useful results. We can
communicate between tasks with pipes. Pipes have two ends: a channel that sends
info down the pipe, and a port that receives info. Here's an example of a
task that sends us back a 10::

  use task::spawn;
  use pipes::stream;
  use pipes::Port;
  use pipes::Chan;

  fn main() {
    let (port, chan): (Port<int>, Chan<int>) = stream();

    do spawn |move chan| {
        chan.send(10);
    }

    io::println(int::str(port.recv()));
  }

You can imagine that instead of sending 10, we might be doing some sort of
complex calculation. It could be doing that work in the background while we
did more important things.

What about that ``move chan`` bit? We want to give our task ownership of the
``chan`` variable, so we tell Rust that we have no interest in doing anything
with it anymore. That's how Rust is able to move the task around if it needs
to: even though we defined ``chan`` here, we relinquished ownership. We'll
talk more about this in the next section.

This is really only one-way transit, though: what if we want to communicate
back and forth? Setting up two ports and channels each time would be pretty
annoying, so we have some standard library code for this: ``DuplexStream``::

  extern mod std;
  use std::comm::DuplexStream;

  use task::spawn;

  fn plus_one(channel: &DuplexStream<int, int>) {
    let mut value: int;
    loop {
      value = channel.recv();
      channel.send(value + 1);
    }
  }

  fn main() {
    let (from_child, to_child) = DuplexStream();

    do spawn |move to_child| {
        plus_one(&to_child);
    };

    from_child.send(22);

    let twenty_three = from_child.recv();
    io::println(int::str(twenty_three));
  }

We make a function that just loops forever, gets an ``int`` off of the port,
and sends the number plus 1 back down the channel. In the main function, we
make a ``DuplexStream``, send one end to a new task (using ``move``), and
then send it a ``22``, and print out the result. Because this task is running
in the background, we can send it bunches of values::

  fn main() {
    let (from_child, to_child) = DuplexStream();

    do spawn |move to_child| {
        plus_one(&to_child);
    };

    from_child.send(22);
    from_child.send(23);
    from_child.send(24);
    from_child.send(25);

    for 4.times {
      let answer = from_child.recv();
      io::println(int::str(answer));
    }
  }

Pretty simple. Our task is always waiting for work. If you run this, you'll get
some weird output at the end::

  $ make                                                                    âœ˜
  rustc fizzbuzz.rs
  warning: no debug symbols in executable (-arch x86_64)
  ./fizzbuzz
  23
  24
  25
  26
  rust: task failed at 'connection closed', fizzbuzz.rs:1
  rust: domain main @0x7ff6eb013e10 root task failed
  make: *** [run] Error 101

'task failed at connection closed: root task failed'. Basically, we quit the
program without closing our child task, and so it died when our main task (the
one running ``main``) died. By default, Rust tasks are bidirectionally linked,
which means if one task fails, all of its children and parents fail too.
We can fix this for now by telling our child to die::

  extern mod std;
  use std::comm::DuplexStream;

  use task::spawn;

  fn plus_one(channel: &DuplexStream<int, int>) {
    let mut value: int;
    loop {
      value = channel.recv();
      channel.send(value + 1);
      if value == 0 { break; }
    }
  }

  fn main() {
    let (from_child, to_child) = DuplexStream();

    do spawn |move to_child| {
        plus_one(&to_child);
    };

    from_child.send(22);
    from_child.send(23);
    from_child.send(24);
    from_child.send(25);
    from_child.send(0);

    for 4.times {
      let answer = from_child.recv();
      io::println(int::str(answer));
    }
  }

Now when we send a zero, our child task terminates. If you run this, you'll
get no errors at the end. We can also change our failure mode. Rust also
provides unidirectional and unlinked failure modes as well, but I don't want to
talk about them right now. This would give you patterns like "Spin up a
management task that is bidirectionally linked to main, but have it spin up
children who are unlinked." Neato.

Rust tasks are so lightweight that you can conceivably spin up a ton of tasks,
maybe even one per entity in your system. Servo_ is a prototype browser
rendering engine from Mozilla, and it spins up a **ton** of tasks. Parallel
rendering, parsing, downloading, everything.

I'm imagining that most production Rust programs will eventually have a main
that spins up some sort of global task setup, and all the work gets done
inside these tasks that communicate with each other. Like, for a video game::

  fn main() {

    do spawn {
      player_handler();
    }

    do spawn {
      world_handler();
    }

    do spawn {
      rendering_handler();
    }

    do spawn {
      io_handler();
    }
  }

... with the associated channels, of course. This feels very Actor-y to me. I
like it. We'll see how these kinds of things develop as Rust moves forward.
