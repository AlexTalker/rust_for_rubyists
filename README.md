Orkestrix: It's Like Coding About Architecture
==============================================

This is a project to solve the problem of easily writing about music.
It will be a set of tools and instruction guides that show you how to:

1. Create HTML or PDF output that includes music scores.
2. Tools for programatically analyzing and generating music based on the scores.
3. Anything else people seem to need to be able to write about music.

This code is being used to create a presentation for RuPy2012 about using
code to analyze and write about music.

Stay tuned for more.
