Dancing About Architecture With Orkestrix
=========================================

This is a project to solve the problem of easily writing about music.
It will be a set of tools and instruction guides that show you how to:

1. Create HTML or PDF output that includes music scores.
2. Tools for programatically analyzing and generating music based on the scores.
2. Simple ways to then publish this to S3, blogs, git, anything.
3. Anything else people seem to need to be able to write about music.

This code is being used to create a presentation for RuPy2012 about using
code to analyze and write about music.

"Dancing About Architecture"?
-----------------------------

There's a joke musicians like to tell that writing about music is 
like dancing about architecture.  Of course, dance is an entirely
interpretive art so, yes, they do in fact dance about architecture,
the life of lizards, how square fish can read orange, and many
other abstract concepts.

But, this lead me to the name.  It comes from Valéria Dienes system
of dance and body movement called "Orchestics" which, while being
about dance, sounds like it's about music.  I figured it was fitting
for a project about writing about music.

Valéria Dienes was super smart. She had a Ph.D. in philosophy, mathematics, and
aesthetics, so even though she was a dancer and dance teacher, she was also a
huge math nerd.
